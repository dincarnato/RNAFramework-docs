The RF Wiggle module can process both RC or ``rf-norm`` output XML files to produce WIGGLE tracks. When provided with RC files, by default RF Wiggle reports the per-base raw RT-stop/mutation count.<br />
RF Wiggle can be invoked both on individual RC/XML files, or on an entire RC/XML folders. <br/>Multiple RC/XML files/folders can be provided at the same time.
<br /><br />

!!! note "Note"
    Input file names will be stripped of their extensions, and automatically used to generate output WIGGLE files.
<br/>
# Usage
To list the required parameters, simply type:

```bash
$ rf-wiggle -h
```

Parameter         | Type | Description
----------------: | :--: |:------------
__-ow__ *or* __--overwrite__ | | Overwrites output file (if the specified file already exists)
__-c__ *or* __--coverage__ | | Reports per-base coverage<br/>__Note:__ this option only works for RC files.
__-r__ *or* __--ratio__ | | Reports per-base ratio between RT-stop/mutation count and coverage<br/>__Note:__ this option only works for RC files.
__-rt__ *or* __--ratio-total__ | | Reports per-base ratio between RT-stop/mutation count and the transcript's total reads count<br/>__Note:__ this option only works for RC files.
__-kb__ *or* __--keep-bases__ | string | Bases to report in the WIG file (Default: __N__ [ACGT])<br/>__Note:__ This parameter accepts any IUPAC code, or their combination (e.g. ``-kb M``, or ``-kb AC``). Any other base will be ignored
