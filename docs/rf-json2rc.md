The RF JSON2RC module performs post-processing of JSON files generated by [DRACO](https://draco-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/draco/), into RC files. These can be further processed via the ``rf-norm`` module to obtain normalized reactivity profiles for structure prediction with the ``rf-fold`` module.<br /><br />

## Understanding the algorithm
Windows are pre-filtered based on a number of criteria:<br/>

1. The median preCoverage (the coverage calculated only on the reads used for the spectral analysis) must be &ge; ``--median-pre-cov``
2. The median cumulative coverage (the sum of the coverage across all the conformations for a given window) must be &ge; ``--median-cov``
3. If ``--skip-zero-cluster-wins`` has been specified, windows for which DRACO failed to identify the number of conformations will be discarded, otherwise they will be assumed to form a single conformation
4. Windows forming &lt; ``--min-confs`` conformations will be discarded
5. Windows forming &gt; ``--max-confs`` conformations will be discarded

DRACO analysis is performed in sliding windows. When two consecutive windows are found to form the same number of conformations, they are automatically merged. However, in certain cases, it might be possible for two non-consecutive overlapping windows forming the same number of conformations, to be interspersed among windows forming a different number of conformations.<br/>Let's consider the following example:
<br/><br/>
![Merging windows](http://www.incarnatolab.com/images/docs/RNAframework/rf-json2rc_mergewins.png)
<br/><br/>
In this case, four windows overlap. Of these, three form 2 conformations, while one forms 3 conformations. As long as the ``--no-merge-overlapping`` parameter has not been specified, the first step of the analysis will consist of merging overlapping windows forming a concordant number of conformations. The minimum overlap between two windows must be &ge; ``--min-overlap-merge`` &times; the length of the smaller window. In the above example, *Win #3* overlaps by 70% of its length with *Win #1*. Similarly, 90% of *Win #4* overlaps with *Win #3*, therefore all three windows could in principle be merged (with default parameters).<br/>
Before being merged, however, the overlapping segments of the conformations making up the two overlapping windows need to be *matched*.<br/>
<br/><br/>
![Window correlation](http://www.incarnatolab.com/images/docs/RNAframework/rf-json2rc_correlation.png)
<br/><br/>
To this end, the pairwise correlation between the reactivity profile for each conformation of the two windows is calculated at the level of the overlap. Any possible combination is evaluated, and the one yielding the highest average correlation coefficient is selected. If the average correlation coefficient exceeds the ``--min-corr-merge`` threshold, the two windows (and corresponding conformations) are merged. If the average correlation does not exceed the threshold, the two windows are not merged. Pearson correlation is used by default; alternatively, Spearman correlation can be used, by specifying the ``--spearman`` parameter. The stoichiometries of the different conformations for the merged windows are averaged.<br/>
If a single JSON file has been provided, the resulting windows are then directly reported in the RC file. If multiple JSON files have been provided, instead, the algorithm will first look for windows common to all replicates.<br/>
<br/><br/>
![Window correlation](http://www.incarnatolab.com/images/docs/RNAframework/rf-json2rc_mergereps.png)
<br/><br/>
Windows overlapping across all the replicates, coherently forming the same number of conformations, are merged if the minimum overlap is &ge; ``--min-overlap-reps`` &times; the length of the smaller window. Only windows common to all replicates will be reported. In the above example *Win #1* and *Win #2* from *Replicate #1* overlap with their counterpart from *Replicate #2*, while *Win #3* does not; therefore, only *Win #1* and *Win 2* could in principle be reported. Analogously to what happens when merging overlapping windows within the same replicate, also in this case the pairwise correlation between the reactivity profile for each conformation of the windows is calculated, and the one yielding the highest average correlation coefficient is selected. If the average correlation coefficient exceeds the ``--min-corr-reps`` threshold, the windows are merged, and reported in the resulting RC file.<br/>
An RC file will be generated for each replicate being analyzed. Naming and sorting of the windows is consistent across replicates. For each window, different conformations are marked by the __\_c<*n*>__ suffix, where __*n*__ is an arbitrary number assigned to a specific conformation. When reporting windows in the output RC file, these can be enlarged both upstream and downstream by ``--extend`` bases, to account for the possibility that the structure(s) formed by a given window might involve extra bases outside of the window's boundaries. By default, these extra bases are assigned both mutation count and coverage of 0. If ``--surround-to-rc`` has been specified, however, the mutation count and coverage for these bases will be directly extracted from the corresponding RC file provided via ``--rc``. This file is supposed to be the RC file generated by ``rf-count`` alongside the MM file that has been analyzed with DRACO. Furthermore, to account for the lower reliability of bases closer to window boundaries, up to 20% of the terminal bases in a window can be masked by specifying the ``--ignore-terminal`` parameter; when doing so, mutation counts and coverage for these bases will be set to 0.<br/>
Alongside with the RC files, the __stoichiometries.txt__ file will be generated, with the following structure:

```text

```
where __Transcript__ is the transcript ID, __start__ and __end__ are the coordinates (0-based) of the window, and __extStart__ and __extEnd__ are the coordinates of the window after being extended by ``--extend`` bases. Following these columns, a column will be present for each replicate having been analyzed, reporting the relative stoichiometries of the conformations for that window.
